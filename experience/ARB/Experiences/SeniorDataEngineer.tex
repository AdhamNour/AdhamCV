        \item \textbf{Airflow-dbt Implementation:} Replaced rigid legacy mappings with \textbf{Apache Airflow} and \textbf{dbt} for 5+ critical workflows, enhancing version control and developer velocity.
        \item \textbf{High-Performance Analytics:} Integrated \textbf{Trino} as the primary query engine to facilitate low-latency interactive analytics over Iceberg tables for enterprise BI tools.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{SIMAH Reporting}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Regulatory Compliance:} Engineered end-to-end data pipelines to aggregate and transform credit risk data for submission to \textbf{SIMAH}, Saudi Arabia's leading credit bureau.
        \item \textbf{Performance Optimization:} Optimized ETL workflows to reduce data processing time by \textbf{30\%}, ensuring timely report generation ahead of regulatory deadlines.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Designed and deployed \textbf{real-time} data ingestion pipelines using \textbf{Apache Kafka, Kafka Connect, Kafka Streams and kSQL} to stream data from core banking, microservices and CRM systems into the data lake, defining data contracts and transformation logic to ensure data quality, scalability, and reliable downstream analytics.
    \item Engineered \textbf{Python}-based automation tools to streamline \textbf{Informatica DEI} troubleshooting and schema reconciliation between \textbf{ERwin} models and physical databases, reducing manual validation and alignment effort by up to 60\% and improving platform reliability.
    \item Led System Integration Testing (SIT) and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for critical data pipelines and BI reports, coordinating across engineering, QA, and business stakeholders to validate correctness, performance, and regulatory compliance. Implemented monitoring and structured feedback loops during testing phases, resolving 95\% of issues prior to production and ensuring stable post-deployment operations.
